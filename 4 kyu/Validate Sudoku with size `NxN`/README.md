[Validate Sudoku with size \`NxN\`](https://www.codewars.com/kata/540afbe2dc9f615d5e000425)

Given a Sudoku data structure with size `NxN, N > 0 and √N == integer`, write a method to validate if it has been filled out correctly.

The data structure is a multi-dimensional Array(in Rust: `Vec<Vec<u32>>`) , ie:

```rust
[
  [7,8,4,  1,5,9,  3,2,6],
  [5,3,9,  6,7,2,  8,4,1],
  [6,1,2,  4,3,8,  7,5,9],

  [9,2,8,  7,1,5,  4,6,3],
  [3,5,7,  8,4,6,  1,9,2],
  [4,6,1,  9,2,3,  5,8,7],

  [8,7,6,  3,9,4,  2,1,5],
  [2,4,3,  5,6,1,  9,7,8],
  [1,9,5,  2,8,7,  6,3,4]
]
```

**Rules for validation**

- Data structure dimension: `NxN` where `N > 0` and `√N == integer`
- Rows may only contain integers: `1..N (N included)`
- Columns may only contain integers: `1..N (N included)`
- *'Little squares'* (`3x3` in example above) may also only contain integers: `1..N (N included)`
