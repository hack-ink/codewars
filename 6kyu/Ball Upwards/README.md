[Ball Upwards](https://www.codewars.com/kata/ball-upwards/train/rust)

You throw a ball vertically upwards with an initial speed `v (in km per hour)`. The height `h` of the ball at each time `t` is given by `h = v*t - 0.5*g*t*t` where `g` is Earth's gravity `(g ~ 9.81 m/s**2)`. A device is recording at every **tenth of second** the height of the ball. For example with `v = 15 km/h` the device gets something of the following form: `(0, 0.0), (1, 0.367...), (2, 0.637...), (3, 0.808...), (4, 0.881..) ...` where the first number is the time in tenth of second and the second number the height in meter.

\# Task:

Write a function `max_ball` with parameter `v (in km per hour)` that returns the `time in tenth of second` of the maximum height recorded by the device.

\# Examples:

`max_ball(15) should return 4`

`max_ball(25) should return 7`

\# Notes:

- Remember to convert the velocity from km/h to m/s or from m/s in km/h when necessary.
- The maximum height recorded by the device is not necessarily the maximum height reached by the ball.

## Thinking

Obviously, when the speed equals zero `(v == 0)`, the ball reach the highest point.

Since `v = gt` and `g = 9.81 (m/s/s)`. (tips: 3.6 km/h = 1 m/s)

Therefore `t = v / g`. (tips: remember to handle the float point problem)
