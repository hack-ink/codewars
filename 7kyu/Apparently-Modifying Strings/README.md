[Apparently-Modifying Strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/apparently-modifying-strings/train/rust)

For every string, after every occurrence of `'and'` and `'but'`, insert the substring `'apparently'` directly after the occurrence.

If input does not contain 'and' or 'but', return the original string. If a blank string, return `''`.

If substring `'apparently'` is already directly after an `'and'` and/or `'but'`, do not add another. (Do not add duplicates).

\# Examples:

Input 1 

```
'It was great and I've never been on live television before but sometimes I don't watch this.'
```

Output 1

```rust
'It was great and apparently I've never been on live television before but apparently sometimes I don't watch this.'
```

Input 2

```rust
'but apparently'
```

Output 2

```rust
'but apparently' 
```

(no changes because `'apparently'` is already directly after `'but'`and there should not be a duplicate.)

An occurrence of `'and'` and/or `'but'` only counts when it is at least one space separated. For example `'andd'` and `'bbut'` do not count as occurrences, whereas `'b but'` and `'and d'` does count.

## Thinking

Use `match` to catch the keyword and finish it in one loop.
