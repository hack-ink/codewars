## Detail

[Grasshopper - Terminal game combat function](https://www.codewars.com/kata/586c1cf4b98de0399300001d)

Create a combat function that takes the player's current health and the amount of damage recieved, and returns the player's new health. Health can't be less than **0.**

## Thinking

Clever: use `max()` rather than `if {} else {}`.
